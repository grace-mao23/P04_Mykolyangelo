# Climate Change Analysis by Mykolyangelo

Grace Mao (PM), Tammy Chen, Jun Tao Lei, and Jackson Zou

## Summary

This project is a proper visualization of CO2, methane, and other
greenhouse gas emissions in different countries from 1960 to 2018. Taken
from the World Bank data for climate change, our team wants to put into
perspective how each country in the world contributes to the total
amount of gases released into the air each year. Users will first see a
world globe, and from then on they can explore different countries
simply by clicking on them or selecting them and then viewing our
graphs, rendered by Javascript's D3. Our data is stored in a SQLite
database, and we are using Bootstrap as our frontend framework to
enhance user experience.
