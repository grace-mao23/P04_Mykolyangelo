# Climate Change Analysis by Mykolyangelo

Grace Mao (PM), Tammy Chen, Jun Tao Lei, and Jackson Zou

# Summary

This project is a proper visualization of CO2, methane, and other 
greenhouse gas emissions in different countries from 1960 to 2018. Taken 
from the World Bank data for climate change, our team wants to put into 
perspective how each country in the world contributes to the total 
amount of gases released into the air each year. Users will first see a 
world globe, and from then on they can explore different countries 
simply by clicking on them or selecting them and then viewing our 
graphs, rendered by Javascript's D3. Our data is stored in a SQLite 
database, and we are using Bootstrap as our frontend framework to 
enhance user experience.
